# DAGIFS Backend

This is the backend code for the [DAGIFS](https://github.com/davidmoina/dagifs-react) application. It provides the logic and functionality needed to support the features of the [DAGIFS](https://github.com/davidmoina/dagifs-react) application. The backend is developed using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Axios, Cloudinary, Mongoose Paginate v2, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

This backend has been developed in a period of 3 days for a technical test simulation together with dagifs-react which is the code for the frontend.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
-   Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
-   Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
-   Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
-   Cloudinary: A cloud-based service for storing and managing images and videos.
-   Mongoose Paginate v2: A pagination plugin for the Mongoose MongoDB library.
